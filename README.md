# LLM_maths_storytelling
Empirical Study on Teaching Math through Storytelling between LLMs and Humans on a student population

## Maths Concepts
- We are using Bayes Probability and Gradient Descent for this comparison. Each have stories from different sources, carrying the name of the LLM creator (ChatGPT, Gemini or Copilote) or an anonymized human (A, B or C).
- Additionally they also have an exercise.txt with questions to test the student understanding of the concepts after reading the story.
- Each concept have a folder of its own located in data/.
