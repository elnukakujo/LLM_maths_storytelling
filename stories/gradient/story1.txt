Picture a university student, Jake, working on a machine learning project. He encounters a cost function, and his aim is to minimize this function to improve his model's performance. Enter Gradient Descent, the algorithmic hero of our story.

Jake starts with a random set of parameters. He then computes the gradient, the slope of the cost function at those parameters. The gradient points in the direction of the steepest ascent, but Jake wants to go downhill. So, he moves in the opposite direction.

The formula for the parameter update is:
\[ \theta_{new} = \theta_{old} - \alpha \cdot \nabla J(\theta_{old}) \]

Here, \(\theta\) represents the parameters, \(\alpha\) is the learning rate, and \(\nabla J(\theta)\) is the gradient of the cost function.

Jake iterates this process: calculating the gradient and updating the parameters. With each step, he gets closer to the minimum, refining his model. Through patience and persistence, Jake masters Gradient Descent, optimizing his model effectively.
