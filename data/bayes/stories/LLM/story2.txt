Imagine a student, Amy, facing a daunting exam. The university decides to give students a heads-up by sharing probabilities of question types. Historically, 70% of exams had probability questions, 50% had calculus, and 30% had both. Amy wonders if her exam will include probability given it has calculus.

Using Bayes' theorem, she reasons. P(Probability | Calculus) is the focus. The theorem suggests:

\[ P(A | B) = \frac{P(B | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

In this case:
\[ P(Probability | Calculus) = \frac{P(Calculus | Probability) \cdot P(Probability)}{P(Calculus)} = \frac{0.3}{0.5} \]

Amy calculates:
\[ \frac{30}{50} \]

and simplifies to:
\[ 0.6 \]

So, there's a 60% chance that her calculus exam will also test probability. Relieved, Amy focuses her studies effectively, tackling her fears and the exam with newfound confidence.
