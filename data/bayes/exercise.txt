Exercise: Medical Test Accuracy

A new test has been developed to detect a rare disease. The disease affects 1 in 1,000 people in the population. The test has the following properties:

    Sensitivity (True Positive Rate): If a person has the disease, the test correctly detects it with a probability of 98%.
    Specificity (True Negative Rate): If a person does not have the disease, the test correctly returns a negative result with a probability of 97%.

Now, suppose a person tests positive for the disease.

Questions

1. Prior Probability: What is the prior probability that a randomly selected person has the disease?

2. Posterior Probability: Using Bayesâ€™ theorem, calculate the probability that this person actually has the disease given that they tested positive.

3. Interpretation: Given the results, explain whether a positive test result should be a cause for concern and why.
