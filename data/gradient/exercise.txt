1. Gradient Calculation: What is the derivative (gradient) of the function f(x)=(x−3)²+5 with respect to xx?

2. Initial Update: Starting with x=0 and a learning rate α=0.1, what is the updated value of x after the first iteration of gradient descent?

3. Iterations: Calculate the values of x for the next four iterations (up to five iterations total).

4. Minimum Value: After five iterations, how close is x to the minimum value of the function?

5. Effect of Learning Rate: If you wanted to converge to the minimum faster, would you increase or decrease the learning rate α, and why?

6. Convergence Check: How would you determine if the algorithm has converged to the minimum?
